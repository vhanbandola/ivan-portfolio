            <p>
                My goals in life are to finish my studies and build a stable career in the IT industry. I aim to find a job that is both fulfilling and financially secure, so I can support my future family. I also want to save enough money to grow and continue our family business, ensuring its success for the next generation. As I grow older, I hope to keep improving myself, learn more technologies, and become someone my family can be proud of.

            <p>
                During my free time, I enjoy playing online games such as Mobile Legends and Genshin Impact. Gaming helps me relax and connect with friends. I also love watching anime — it inspires me creatively and introduces me to different stories and worlds.

            <p>
                My life hasn’t always been easy, but every challenge I faced helped shape who I am today. I grew up in a simple family, and at a young age, I learned the importance of hard work and responsibility. During my school years, I discovered my interest in technology and computers, which pushed me to pursue a degree in Information Technology. <br><br> My journey as an IT student has been filled with challenges — from difficult lessons to late-night coding sessions — but each struggle taught me patience, determination, and resourcefulness. I learned that growth happens outside of my comfort zone and that believing in myself is one of the most important steps toward success. <br><br> Today, I continue to improve my skills with the goal of helping my family and building a better future. I want to become someone who can support them, make them proud, and create a life that reflects all our hard work and sacrifices.
